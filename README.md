# 6303_10_Final_Project
**Breast Cancer Ultrasound Images**


Breast cancer is a significant health concern worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Deep learning models, have emerged as a promising tool for breast cancer diagnosis and segmentation. These models for breast cancer ultrasound image analysis, with a focus on segmentation, hold significant potential in improving the accuracy and efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment enhancing the capabilities of healthcare professionals, aiding in early detection and precise localization of breast cancer lesions.
